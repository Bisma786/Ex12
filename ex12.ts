// Q:12 Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Names:string[]=["Lubna","Uzma","Saba","Azra"];


for(let Name of Names){
    console.log(`Hey! ${Name}, I hope my message finds you well`)
}
